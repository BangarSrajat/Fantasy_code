                        <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: March 1st, 2024</p>
<h2>What are cookies?</h2>
<p>Cookies are small text files that a website places on your computer or mobile device when you access the site. These files come in two main types. First-party cookies are those set directly by the site you're visiting and are readable only by that website. Additionally, a site may utilize third-party cookies from external services, which set their own cookies.</p>
<p>Persistent cookies remain on your computer and aren't deleted when you close your browser, unlike session cookies, which are removed when the browser is closed. Each time you access the Commission’s websites, you will be asked to either accept or reject cookies.</p>
<p>The purpose of cookies is to allow the website to remember your preferences (like username, language, etc.) for a certain time, so you don't have to input them repeatedly as you navigate through the site. Cookies also help us compile anonymous statistics about your browsing activities on our websites.</p>
<h2>How do we use cookies?</h2>
<p>The websites of the European Commission primarily use “first-party cookies,” which are set and managed by the Commission. Nonetheless, certain pages require you to accept cookies from third parties in order to access their content.</p>
<p>We utilize three categories of first-party cookies:</p>
<p>Storing visitor preferences: These remember your cookie policy acceptance or refusal, and if you've already responded to our survey about site content usefulness.</p>
<p>Operational cookies: These are necessary for some web pages to function and do not require your consent, including authentication cookies and technical cookies necessary for some IT systems.</p>
<p>Analytics cookies: Used exclusively for internal research on enhancing the service we provide. These cookies anonymously monitor your interaction with our website, and this information isn’t shared with third parties or used for any other purpose. Anonymized data might be shared with contractors engaged in communication projects under contractual obligations with the Commission.</p>
<h2>Third-party cookies</h2>
<p>Some of our pages feature content from external providers, such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter. To view this content, you must agree to their terms and conditions, which include their cookie policies. If you choose not to view this content, no third-party cookies will be placed on your device. These services operate independently of the Commission, and their providers may change their terms, cookie use, etc., at any time.</p>
<h2>How can you manage cookies?</h2>
<p>Removing cookies from your device: You can eliminate all cookies by clearing your browser's browsing history, but this will also remove any stored information (like login details, site preferences).</p>
<p>Managing site-specific cookies: For more control, check the privacy and cookie settings of your browser.</p>
<p>Blocking cookies: Most modern browsers allow you to prevent cookies from being placed on your device, but you may need to manually adjust some settings every time you visit a site. Note that some services and functionalities may not function properly (such as logging into a profile).</p>
