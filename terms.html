                        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
                        <p>Last Updated: March 1st, 2024</p>
                        <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms of Use") represent a legally binding contract between you, the user ("user" or "you"), and Cricdesi.in ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"). These Terms govern your use of our website and the services it offers ("Services" as defined below). Our Privacy Policy is incorporated into these Terms of Use, and collectively, they are referred to as the "Terms." It is crucial for you to read the Terms thoroughly before accessing or utilizing our website and Services.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Acceptance of the Terms:</h2>
                        <p>By accessing or using our website or the Services, you confirm that you have read, comprehended, and agree to these Terms of Use. You agree to abide by these Terms of Use and comply with all applicable laws and regulations while using the Services. Additionally, you acknowledge that these Terms of Use form a legally enforceable contract between you and us, which includes a class action waiver and an arbitration provision as detailed below in the dispute resolution section. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PART OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS THE WEBSITE OR USE THE SERVICES IN ANY WAY.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Third-party cookies</h2>
                        <p>Some of our pages feature content from external providers, such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter. To view this content, you must agree to their terms and conditions, which include their cookie policies. If you choose not to view this content, no third-party cookies will be placed on your device. These services operate independently of the Commission, and their providers may change their terms, cookie use, etc., at any time.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Eligibility and Age Restriction:</h2>
                        <p>You affirm that you are eligible to enter into these Terms of Use and are not prohibited by any legal authority, court order, or law from doing so. If you are acting on behalf of a corporation, you confirm that you have the appropriate authorization to enter into these Terms of Use. Moreover, you represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years old and legally competent to enter into these Terms. We reserve the right to request proof of age at any time to ensure that minors under the age of eighteen (18) are not using our website.</p>
                        <p>Our Contests are available only to individuals who are 18 years or older and reside in India at the time of participation. Cricdesi, in line with the laws of specific Indian states, prohibits residents of certain states from participating in any Contests. At present, residents of Assam, Odisha, Telangana, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Andhra Pradesh in India are not permitted to engage in any paid or cash Contests due to state laws that restrict residents from taking part in online games where participants must pay to enter contests like Fantasy Cricket rooms.</p>
                        <p>Participants must have a valid email address to join the Contests. Only participants who have successfully registered on Cricdesi.in and have registered for a Contest prior to each round, following the rules outlined above, are eligible to participate and win prizes.</p>
