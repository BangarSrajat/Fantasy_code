                        <h2><h1>Privacy Policy</h1></h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Fantasy-match operates a mobile app under its flagship brand, encompassing all content and features provided by Fantasy-match (the “Service”), including contests and services. The platform allows users to predict cricket performances and win prizes through its mobile apps available on Google Play, Apple App Store, and the Fantasy-match website. By using the Service, you agree to these Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy. Additional rules may apply to specific contests, especially those affected by regional regulations, which you must comply with.</p>
<h2>Information Collection</h2>
<p>To use the app's services, users must provide their name, mobile number, and email address for verification and communication. Additional information like gender or date of birth can be shared for personalized offers. The app may also collect data such as your IP address, device type, and location to operate the service and maintain its quality. Bank account details and KYC information are required to withdraw winnings.</p>
<h2>Third-Party Sharing & Legal Disclosures</h2>
<p>Fantasy-match does not sell or lease customer data but may share it with trusted partners for analysis and support. Fantasy-match may disclose your information if required by law or to protect its rights or users' safety.</p>
<h2>Data Deletion</h2>
<p>Users can request data deletion by emailing <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b3c0c6c3c3dcc1c7f3d5d2ddc7d2c0ca9eded2c7d0db9ddadd">[email&#160;protected]</a>, and the data will be deleted within one month of the request.</p>
<h2>Modification of Terms</h2>
<p>Fantasy-match reserves the right to modify the Terms of Use (except Section 14 on Dispute Resolution) at any time by posting updates on the Site. You are responsible for reviewing changes, and continued use of the Services implies acceptance.</p>
<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>By entering a contest, you confirm that you are 18 or older, a resident of India, and located in a state where participation is legal. Certain states prohibit paid contests. You must not be on any government-restricted list or have a gambling conviction. If found ineligible, Fantasy-match may terminate your account, revoke prizes, or limit withdrawals.</p>
<h2>Registration and Account Access</h2>
<p>To participate, you must register with accurate information. Only one account is allowed per person. Fantasy-match may suspend or terminate accounts with false information or multiple accounts. Accounts are for gaming purposes only; misuse may result in suspension and reporting to authorities.</p>
<h2>Communications</h2>
<p>By registering, you agree to receive communications from Fantasy-match. You can opt out, but essential communications may still be sent.</p>
<h2>Disqualification and Cancellation</h2>
<p>Fantasy-match can disqualify users for misconduct, such as falsifying information or tampering with the Service, and may pursue legal action. Contests may be canceled or suspended due to technical issues or external factors.</p>
<h2>Deposits and Withdrawals</h2>
<p>By depositing funds or entering paid contests, you agree to provide necessary identity verification information. Fantasy-match may conduct checks and suspend accounts pending verification. Deposits and winnings are held in a segregated account, with deposit limits as required by law.</p>
<h2>Taxation</h2>
<p>Prizes are subject to tax deductions as per the Income Tax Act 1961. You are responsible for filing and paying any applicable taxes on your winnings.</p>
<h2>Publicity</h2>
<p>By entering a contest, you consent to Fantasy-match’s use of your name, likeness, and other details for promotional purposes, unless prohibited by law. Participation constitutes full compensation for publicity rights.</p>
<h2>Game Rules</h2>
<p>Indian courts, including the Supreme Court, have affirmed that games of skill, such as fantasy sports, are legally distinct from gambling. Fantasy-match’s contests are considered games of skill, relying on participants' knowledge of cricket and player performance.</p>
<h2>Contest(s) and Team(s)</h2>
<p>Fantasy-match offers various fantasy cricket contests where users create teams based on real-life cricketers. Teams can be modified until the official match start time. Deadlines may be adjusted due to delays. Both free and paid contests are available, with entry fees contributing to the prize pool.</p>
<h2>Gaming Currency and Virtual Wallet</h2>
<p>Fantasy-match uses 'Gold Nanyas' as virtual currency, stored in the Gullak wallet. Gold Nanyas can be used to enter paid contests, and winnings can be converted to real money, gift cards, or coupons.</p>
<h2>Entry Fees</h2>
<p>Paid contests require an entry fee in Gold Nanyas, debited from the user's Gullak account. Participation is confirmed upon payment, and cancellations are not allowed.</p>
<h2>Gullak Sub-Accounts and Payment Terms</h2>
<p>Fantasy-match maintains two primary payment accounts: (i) Recharge Account and (ii) Winnings Account, plus a Promo Bonus Account. Winnings can be withdrawn or redeemed, and payments include a platform fee. Unused balances may be forfeited after 335 days.</p>
<h2>Contest Term</h2>
<p>Fantasy-match hosts contests for professional cricket events, typically lasting one day or up to five days for Test matches.</p>
<h2>Fantasy Points Calculation</h2>
<p>Fantasy-match relies on third-party providers or official match organizers to gather data for fantasy points calculation. Errors in data may affect the computation of points and winner selection. While Fantasy-match strives to correct such errors, it is not responsible for inaccuracies from these sources. Gamers agree not to hold Fantasy-match accountable for such issues.</p>
<h2>Determining Winners</h2>
<p>Winners are based on the highest team scores in a match or tournament. In some contests, multiple winners may be declared, with prizes distributed accordingly. In case of a tie, prizes are equally divided. Fantasy-match may disqualify winners who violate terms or rules.</p>
<h2>Prizes</h2>
<p>Tentative winners are announced by the next day, pending verification. Prizes in Gold Nanyas are added to the winner's Gullak account. Fantasy-match reserves the right to adjust results due to data errors or rule violations. Prizes may be withheld if legally challenged, and Fantasy-match’s decision on disputes is final.</p>
<h2>Verification and Taxation</h2>
<p>Winners must complete verification to withdraw winnings. All prizes over Rs. 10,000 are subject to a 30% TDS, deducted from net winnings. Winners are responsible for additional taxes and will receive TDS certificates.</p>
<h2>Notification</h2>
<p>Winners' names are posted on the App and notified by 10 AM IST the following day. They may need to submit eligibility affidavits, publicity agreements, and tax forms. Failure to comply may lead to disqualification.</p>
<h2>Promotions and Promo Bonus</h2>
<p>Fantasy-match may issue promotional Gold Nanyas (Promo Bonus) for contests. Promo Bonus cannot be transferred or withdrawn and must be used within the specified time. Fantasy-match reserves the right to reclaim unused Promo Bonuses.</p>
<h2>Referrals and Referral Bonus</h2>
<p>Fantasy-match’s referral program rewards users for inviting friends who join and verify their accounts. Both the referrer and referee receive bonuses, which can be used for contest entry, redeemed for rewards, or withdrawn. Referral bonuses are subject to specific eligibility and usage conditions.</p>
<h2>Statistics Providers</h2>
<p>Fantasy-match relies on third-party providers for score feeds and data needed to compute fantasy points. If errors arise from inaccurate data, Fantasy-match will attempt to correct them before distributing prizes.</p>
<h2>Conduct</h2>
<p>Users agree not to engage in unlawful activities, harassment, impersonation, or transmission of offensive content. Unauthorized uses, such as spamming, hacking, or inflating leaderboard positions, are prohibited. Violations may lead to content removal, account termination, and forfeiture of winnings.</p>
<h2>User Content</h2>
<p>Users are responsible for the content they post. Fantasy-match may remove or modify content at its discretion. By submitting content, users grant Fantasy-match a license to use it. Fantasy-match may monitor disputes but is not obligated to intervene.</p>

<p>Users agree to indemnify Fantasy-match against claims arising from their use of the Service or violation of terms, including legal fees and third-party claims.</p>
<h2>Warranty Disclaimers</h2>
<p>Fantasy-match provides the Service "AS IS" without warranties. Users access the Service at their own risk, and Fantasy-match is not responsible for content or actions taken based on it.</p>

<h2>Termination and Suspension</h2>
<p>Fantasy-match can terminate or suspend your account and access to the Service immediately if you breach any terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ends. You may request account termination by contacting Fantasy-match. Certain terms, like Conduct, Indemnity, and Dispute Resolution, will survive termination. If suspended, you must follow account restrictions and communicate only via <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c3b0b6b3b3acb1b783a5a2adb7a2b0baeeaea2b7a0abedaaad">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</p>
<h2>No Third-Party Beneficiaries</h2>
<p>These Terms do not create any third-party rights.</p>
<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>Disputes related to Fantasy-match Services will be governed by Indian law and handled exclusively in Mumbai courts. Disputes should first be resolved amicably; if not resolved in 15 days, they go to arbitration in Mumbai. The arbitrator's decision is final. Fantasy-match can seek court relief without waiving arbitration rights.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>Fantasy-match may notify users of important events via the app or email. Users must keep contact info updated. Fantasy-match is not liable for delays or failures due to uncontrollable events (e.g., natural disasters, wars). Fantasy-match’s rights remain even if not enforced. Claims against Fantasy-match must be filed within 30 days. These Terms are the entire agreement and will remain effective even if parts are found invalid. Fantasy-match reserves the right to restrict or ban users and may suspend or close services at its discretion. Promotions on the platform cannot be combined.</p>
